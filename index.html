            Tiny Leaders is a singleton Magic: the Gathering format with tiny cost cards, in a tiny sized deck.
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        All cards in your deck must have a mana value of three or less, you play with exactly 50 cards decks, and you are also allowed to have a sideboard of exactly 10 cards.
        Your deck will also have to follow your commander color identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the deck shares some similarities with Commander it is recommended as a 1v1 format.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are multiple sub formats of Tiny Leaders (that you can read about <a href="{{ "formats" | relative_url }}">here</a>), of these one Reborn is the biggest
        and will be the only one this website highlights. The ban list, rules and faq are all for the Reborn format.<br><br>
