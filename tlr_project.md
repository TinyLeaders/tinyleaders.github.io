## Tiny Leaders: Reborn
We are a group of players and tournament organizers who deeply love the Tiny Leaders format initiated in 2013
by Bramwell Tackaberry and Steven Hamonic.

Very popular with players from around the world, Tiny Leaders is thought of by the community as a mini-Duel 
Commander or mini Singleton Legacy.

Due to various circumstances, the original creators fell behind updating the rules and stopped maintaining a
banlist and rules

In order to preserve this format, in early 2017, some Europeans stepped up to preserve Tiny Leaders,
and created the Tiny Leaders Reborn project

By listening to you, but also by monitoring and analyzing the results of the tournaments to adjust the
Ban List as well as possible.

We hope that the original creators, when they have a calmer life, will take part in this renewal with us.

This recovery is obviously based on the rules and banlist existing at the formation of this committee.
Our group contains representatives of many communities but, if you have a Tiny Leaders player community meeting regularly, feel free to contact us to keep TLR alive.

See you around a table.
