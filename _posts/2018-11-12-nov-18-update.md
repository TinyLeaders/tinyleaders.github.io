<h4>
    <li> Any planeswalker of CCM 3 or less can be used as a commander  </li>
</h4>




### Planeswalker can be commanders

Regarding the format itself and your feedback, it is clear that the metagame is healthy. Admittedly, there are some obvious "deck to beat" (Leovold loam, Marath, Geist of St Traft ...) but nothing too oppressive and diversity is present.

As such, no ban or unban will take place today.

However, after lot of testings, and to further deepen this diversity (and meet the expectations of many gaming groups already using this rule) we are modifying a rule in Tiny Leaders Reborn.

From today, and officially in tournament, you will be able to apply it:
_"Any planeswalker of CCM 3 or less can be used as a commander"_

We are aware that some of them can be very strong and oppressive for the format, and we will keep our attention on them.
