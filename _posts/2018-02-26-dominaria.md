### Mox Diamond and Chrome Mox

As for the duel commander, the balance of the Moxes relies on the
sacrifice of active ressource at games starts. However, the commander is a
redundant resource available all game long, and in the Tiny Leaders 1 or 2
lands + mox means most of the time that you will be able to play your commander
as early as turn 2.
Most commanders will make a direct impact on games such as giving you
immediate new ressources as remplacement, or needing more than 1 card to handle
with. These decks are able to make profitable the moxes even in mid games where
they recycle them for card advantage (ex : liliana of the veil +1 ability, jace
vryn’s prodige, brainstorm shuffling...)
The combination of the characteristics of these 2 moxes (not requiring
strict building like Opal or Amber) along Tiny explosiveness and commander
repeatable ressource creates an undesireble variance.
For creating an imbalance in the games and too often determine the outcome
of games, those two cards (Mox Diamond + Chrome Mox) are now banned.


### Sword of Body and Mind

Considering:

- This Sword like all the others needs a creature to be equipped. Like for
  the other swords, it will take almost 3 to 4 turns to be able to kill and
  opponent (maybe 2 only if equipped on a double-strike creature).
- Most tournament results seems to show Control decks are really well
  positioned in metagame, and the decks based on agressives creatures are in the
  second half of tournament (except Aggro/Burn, Combo based creature and Midrange
  Strats)
- Milling opponent is as in all EDH formats isn’t the best idea in many
  matchups (using a lot their discard pile)
- This Sword have two of the worst color protection against targeted
  anticreature spells and abilities
  We think it is healthy to allow this again, keeping a eye on tournament
  results.
  Sword of Body and Mind is now allowed in your decks.
