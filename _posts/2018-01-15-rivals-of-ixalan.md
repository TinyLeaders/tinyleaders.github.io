### Goblin Recruiter

A card that was banned from the beginning by the creators without, however in a format to CCM3, become a particular threat. It ensures on your next turns a way to assure â€œa good sequence", but will very rarely leave place for a real combo. Wishing to encourage these marginal decks to make the format accessible to the greatest number, we remove from the banned list this map.

### True Name Nemesis

Card that does not win by itself, or slowly enough compared how fast is the format, but that strongly prevents losing the games in which you get to put it in play. Its resilient nature added to its blue color, make it a card very difficult (nearly impossible) to manage for some colors. Green, Red and Blue can hardly handle it once in play. White and Artifact will do it either with difficulty (need to attack Wing Shards, Blessed alliance...) or in many turns (Ratchet bomb, Oblivion stone...). Only Black is effectively armed to handle it.
Numerous results point to final tournament games where its impact has been strongly raised by its passive defense and "unmanageable" with the constraints of CCM3.
The merfolk becomes with the new Ixalans set even more oppressive with enhanced boosts and protection possibilities.


### Gaea's Craddle

With the ban of High Tide, it is naturally this land that took a lot of places in Top Tier of partner groups. We always wait for it in the decks Elves, but it is via the decks Animar or Marath that it proved to be the most effective. Difficult for these three archetypes to lose a game once the land is in play, if they do not face Black or Red decks playing wrath effects or land destruction.
This ban allows among other things to reduce the raw power of ElfBall decks, star decks combos in Tiny Leaders, without punishing too much the strategy that will remain explosive. Nykthos is often a more effective land, and the appearance of Growing Rites of Utlimoc will potentially replace the map if the effect is needed

### Four colors (or more) decks are legal

It is now possible to play 4 or more colors in the format with two kind of different color Partners.
This decision comes after feedback from all the groups that participated in our survey. Nearly 70% of the players voted in favor of this authorization.
The tiny leaders have very strict rules for deck constructions. In order not to complicate the task even more and to follow the movement of the EDH and Duels commander formats, we will "test" this possibility in Tiny Leaders tournaments.
