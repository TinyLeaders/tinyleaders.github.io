Play Rule 8 says you can only cast one of them _command zone_. Does that mean you can use other means to get it into your hand and cast it?

> Correct! If you manage to get it into your hand or graveyard you can cast it from there.

Are Companions allowed?
> Yes! One of your 10 sideboard cards can be a companion given that it follows all other rules of the format.
