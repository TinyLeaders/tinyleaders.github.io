Play Rule 8 says you can only cast one of them _command zone_. Does that mean you can use other means to get it into your hand and cast it?

> Correct! If you manage to get it into your hand or graveyard you can cast it from there.

Are Companions allowed?
> Yes! One of your 10 sideboard cards can be a companion given that it follows all other rules of the format.

What about activating abilities?
> Currently, the activation cost of abilities on a card does not need to adhere to the Mana Rule, you can still play cards like {% card Covetous Castaway%}

Can I play {% card Birgi, God of Storytelling %}?
> No, per the Mana Rule Tiny Leaders consider both sides of a MDFC card when accounting for cost.
